### Welcome!

You're probably looking for [the list](/lumt). You can just click the link and skip reading this awfully long text.

_NOTE: This article is not complete yet._

## What is this?

This is a list of useful Minecraft tools, software, websites, [cheatsheets](/cheatsheets/), etc. This website also contains a [blog](/a/) (still in development) and other small pages.
This website has evolved far beyond just a list.

## Why?

A few days ago (for me, December 2025) I was searching for Minecraft websites — when I'm bored or just feel like something's missing I search for nerdy websites — but I didn't really find a list. (Although there are [a few](a/other-lists).) If you look at this list, you might say: "But there are a few of them, so why did you make this list?"
And that's _kinda_ true: only the first few links are actual lists with more than 20 items and different core ideas, so I wanted to _merge_ them and add more items. (And I did: as of 30 December 2025 the list contains 157 items!)

### Welcome!

You're probably looking for [the list](/lumt). You can just click the link and skip reading this awfully long text.

_NOTE: This article is not complete yet._

A few days ago (for me december 2025) I was searching for Minecraft websites (when im bored or just feel like somethings missing I just search for neardy websites), but I didn't really find a list. (Although there are [a few](a/other-lists)) Now, if you looked at this list, you might say: "But there are a few of them, so why did you make this list?"
And thats _kinda_ true, but only the first two links are real list with more than 20 items and have different items and core ideas, so I just wanted to _merge_ them and add more items. (And I did, on 30th december 2025 the list contains 157 items)
